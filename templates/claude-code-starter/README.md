# Claude Code Starter

The simplest "an agent writes it, SettleMesh ships it" starter: a tiny Next.js app
with SettleMesh OAuth login and a managed database, ready to deploy.

**The differentiator:** SettleMesh is the launch layer for agent-built apps. You get
login, a database, usage metering, and end-user payments without writing billing
code — charge your users per use, and SettleMesh handles the money.

> **Aev** is SettleMesh prepaid credit (1 USD = 100 Aev), funded via Stripe.

## Quickstart

```
npm i -g settlemesh
git clone <this repo>
settlemesh login
settlemesh deploy
```

## What you get

- **Login** — SettleMesh OAuth in lazy mode. Sign-in only fires when the user clicks;
  the edge serves `/__settle/login`, `/__settle/logout`, and `/__settle/me` for you.
- **Database** — a managed database is provisioned from `settlemesh.json`. Credentials
  are injected at runtime; see `app/api/hello/route.ts` for a query example.
- **Usage billing & payments** — when you add metered SettleMesh capabilities, your
  users pay per use in Aev with no billing code on your side. This starter ships with
  login + DB; see https://settlemesh.io/agent.md to wire up metered capabilities.

## The badge

`components/powered-by-settlemesh.tsx` renders a small "Powered by SettleMesh" badge.
It is **optional** — delete that file and its import in `app/page.tsx` to remove it.
